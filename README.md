# BarbezDotEu.Millennial

Pretend it's 2004 and encode a text like a millennial would on MSN Messenger. Decode them too!

BarbezDotEu.Millennial is able to 'deobfuscate' (i.e. decode) a text by removing select Unicode lookalikes of letters and replace them with its corresponding character from the English alphabet.

At the same time, it can also 'obfuscate' (i.e. encode) a text into an alternative text containing random emojis and other 'strange' characters, just like a millennial would in e.g. 2004.
